Hi. This is the first lecture in MIT's course 18.06,
0:14
linear algebra, and I'm Gilbert Strang.
0:19
The text for the course is this book, Introduction to Linear Algebra.
0:26
And the course web page, which has got a lot of exercises from
0:32
the past, MatLab codes, the syllabus for the course,
0:38
is web.mit.edu/18.06.
0:44
And this is the first lecture, lecture one.
0:49
So, and later we'll give the web address for viewing these,
0:55
videotapes. Okay, so what's in the first lecture?
The Problem
1:02
This is my plan. The fundamental problem of linear algebra,
1:09
which is to solve a system of linear equations. So let's start with a case when we
1:16
have some number of equations, say n equations and n unknowns.
1:21
So an equal number of equations and unknowns. That's the normal, nice case.
1:26
And what I want to do is -- with examples, of course --
1:31
to describe, first, what I call the Row picture.
1:37
That's the picture of one equation at a time. It's the picture you've seen before in two
1:43
by two equations where lines meet. So in a minute, you'll see lines meeting.
1:49
The second picture, I'll put a star beside that, because that's such an important one.
1:55
And maybe new to you is the picture -- a column at a time.
2:01
And those are the rows and columns of a matrix. So the third -- the algebra way to look at the problem is
2:08
the matrix form and using a matrix that I'll call A. Okay, so can I do an example?
2:17
The whole semester will be examples and then see what's
2:23
going on with the example. So, take an example. Two equations, two unknowns.
The Matrix
2:30
So let me take 2x -y =0, let's say.
2:38
And -x 2y=3.
2:45
Okay. let me -- I can even say right away --
2:50
what's the matrix, that is, what's the coefficient matrix?
2:57
The matrix that involves these numbers -- a matrix is just a rectangular array of numbers.
3:05
Here it's two rows and two columns, so 2 and -- minus 1 in the first row minus 1 and 2 in the second row,
3:14
that's the matrix. And the right-hand -- the, unknown --
3:21
well, we've got two unknowns. So we've got a vector, with two components, x and y,
3:27
and we've got two right-hand sides that go into a vector 0 3.
3:32
I couldn't resist writing the matrix form, right --
3:38
even before the pictures. So I always will think of this as the matrix A,
3:45
the matrix of coefficients, then there's a vector of unknowns. Here we've only got two unknowns.
3:51
Later we'll have any number of unknowns. And that vector of unknowns, well I'll often --
3:57
I'll make that x -- extra bold. A and the right-hand side is also a vector
4:04
that I'll always call b. So linear equations are A x equal b and the idea now
4:13
is to solve this particular example and then step back to see the bigger picture.
4:20
Okay, what's the picture for this example, the Row picture? Okay, so here comes the Row picture.
4:26
So that means I take one row at a time
4:32
and I'm drawing here the xy plane
4:38
and I'm going to plot all the points that
4:43
satisfy that first equation. So I'm looking at all the points that satisfy 2x-y =0.
4:53
It's often good to start with which point on the horizontal
4:59
line -- on this horizontal line, y is zero. The x axis has y as zero and that -- in this case, actually,
5:06
then x is zero. So the point, the origin -- the point with coordinates (0,0) is on the line.
5:16
It solves that equation. Okay, tell me in -- well, I guess I have to tell you
5:22
another point that solves this same equation. Let me suppose x is one, so I'll take x to be one.
5:32
Then y should be two, right? So there's the point one two that also solves this equation.
5:40
And I could put in more points. But, but let me put in all the points
5:45
at once, because they all lie on a straight line.
5:50
This is a linear equation and that word linear got the letters Okay, thanks. for line in it.
5:56
That's the equation -- this is the line that ... of solutions to 2x-y=0 my first row, first equation.
6:08
So typically, maybe, x equal a half, y equal one will work.
6:14
And sure enough it does. Okay, that's the first one. Now the second one is not going to go through the origin.
6:22
It's always important. Do we go through the origin or not? In this case, yes, because there's a zero over there.
6:30
In this case we don't go through the origin, because if x and y are zero, we don't get three.
6:36
So, let me again say suppose y is zero, what x do we actually get?
6:42
If y is zero, then I get x is minus three.
6:48
So if y is zero, I go along minus three. So there's one point on this second line.
6:56
Now let me say, well, suppose x is minus one --
7:03
just to take another x. If x is minus one, then this is a one
7:09
and I think y should be a one, because if x is minus one,
7:15
then I think y should be a one and we'll get that point. Is that right?
7:20
If x is minus one, that's a one. If y is a one, that's a two and the one and the two make three and that point's on the equation.
7:28
Okay. Now, I should just draw the line, right, connecting those two points at --
7:34
that will give me the whole line. And if I've done this reasonably well,
7:40
I think it's going to happen to go through -- well, not happen -- it was arranged to go through that point.
7:46
So I think that the second line is this one, and this is the all-important point that lies on both lines.
7:56
Shall we just check that that point which is the point x equal one and y was two, right?
8:03
That's the point there and that, I believe, solves both equations.
8:10
Let's just check this. If x is one, I have a minus one plus four equals three, okay.
8:18
Apologies for drawing this picture that you've seen before.
8:25
But this -- seeing the row picture -- first of all, for n equal 2, two equations and two unknowns,
8:33
it's the right place to start. Okay. So we've got the solution. The point that lies on both lines.
8:39
Now can I come to the column picture? Pay attention, this is the key point.
8:47
So the column picture. I'm now going to look at the columns of the matrix.
8:53
I'm going to look at this part and this part. I'm going to say that the x part is really x times --
9:05
you see, I'm putting the two -- I'm kind of getting the two equations at once --
9:10
that part and then I have a y and in the first equation
9:15
it's multiplying a minus one and in the second equation a two, and on the right-hand side, zero and three.
9:22
You see, the columns of the matrix, the columns of A
9:29
are here and the right-hand side b is there. And now what is the equation asking for?
9:36
It's asking us to find -- somehow to combine that vector
9:42
and this one in the right amounts to get that one. It's asking us to find the right linear combination --
9:51
this is called a linear combination. And it's the most fundamental operation in the whole course.
9:58
It's a linear combination of the columns.
10:06
That's what we're seeing on the left side. Again, I don't want to write down a big definition.
10:13
You can see what it is. There's column one, there's column two. I multiply by some numbers and I add.
10:21
That's a combination -- a linear combination and I want to make those numbers the right numbers to produce zero three.
10:30
Okay. Now I want to draw a picture that, represents what this --
10:37
this is algebra. What's the geometry, what's the picture that goes with it? Okay.
10:42
So again, these vectors have two components, so I better draw a picture like that.
10:50
So can I put down these columns? I'll draw these columns as they are, and then I'll do a combination of them.
10:58
So the first column is over two and down one, right?
11:04
So there's the first column. The first column. Column one.
11:10
It's the vector two minus one. The second column is --
11:18
minus one is the first component and up two. It's here.
11:24
There's column two. So this, again, you see what its components are.
11:32
Its components are minus one, two. Good. That's this guy.
11:39
Now I have to take a combination. What combination shall I take?
11:47
Why not the right combination, what the hell? Okay. So the combination I'm going to take
11:53
is the right one to produce zero three and then we'll see it happen in the picture.
11:59
So the right combination is to take x as one of those and two of these.
12:06
It's because we already know that that's the right x and y,
12:12
so why not take the correct combination here and see it happen? Okay, so how do I picture this linear combination?
12:21
So I start with this vector that's already here -- so that's one of column one, that's one times column
12:28
one, right there. And now I want to add on -- so I'm going to hook the next
12:33
vector onto the front of the arrow will start the next vector and it will go this way.
12:40
So let's see, can I do it right? If I added on one of these vectors,
12:46
it would go left one and up two, so we'd go left one and up two, so it would probably get us to there.
12:52
Maybe I'll do dotted line for that. Okay? That's one of column two tucked onto the end,
12:59
but I wanted to tuck on two of column two. So that -- the second one -- we'll go up left one and up two
13:07
also. It'll probably end there. And there's another one. So what I've put in here is two of column two.
13:14
Added on. And where did I end up?
13:20
What are the coordinates of this result?
13:28
What do I get when I take one of this plus two of that? I do get that, of course.
13:34
There it is, x is zero, y is three, that's b. That's the answer we wanted.
13:41
And how do I do it? You see I do it just like the first component.
13:46
I have a two and a minus two that produces a zero, and in the second component I have a minus one and a four,
13:54
they combine to give the three. But look at this picture.
14:01
So here's our key picture. I combine this column and this column to get this guy.
14:10
That was the b. That's the zero three. Okay. So that idea of linear combination is crucial,
14:18
and also -- do we want to think about this question?
14:25
Sure, why not. What are all the combinations? If I took -- can I go back to xs and ys?
14:32
This is a question for really --
14:38
it's going to come up over and over, but why don't we see it once now?
14:45
If I took all the xs and all the ys, all the combinations,
14:50
what would be all the results? And, actually, the result would be
14:56
that I could get any right-hand side at all. The combinations of this and this
15:02
would fill the whole plane. You can tuck that away.
15:08
We'll, explore it further.
15:14
But this idea of what linear combination gives b and what do
15:19
all the linear combinations give, what are all the possible, achievable right-hand sides be
15:25
-- that's going to be basic. Okay. Can I move to three equations and three unknowns?
15:31
Because it's easy to picture the two by two case.
15:38
Let me do a three by three example. Okay, I'll sort of start it the same way, say maybe 2x-y and maybe I'll take no zs as a zero and maybe
15:50
a -x 2y and maybe a -z as a -- oh,
15:55
let me make that a minus one and, just for variety let me
16:01
take, -3z, -3ys, I should keep the ys in that line,
16:09
and 4zs is, say, 4. Okay.
16:16
That's three equations. I'm in three dimensions, x, y, z.
16:22
And, I don't have a solution yet. So I want to understand the equations and then solve them.
16:32
Okay. So how do I you understand them? The row picture one way.
16:37
The column picture is another very important way. Just let's remember the matrix form, here,
16:43
because that's easy. The matrix form -- what's our matrix A?
16:49
Our matrix A is this right-hand side, the two and the minus one
16:54
and the zero from the first row, the minus one and the two and the minus one from the second row,
17:00
the zero, the minus three and the four from the third row.
17:08
So it's a three by three matrix. Three equations, three unknowns. And what's our right-hand side?
17:14
Of course, it's the vector, zero minus one, four.
17:20
Okay. So that's the way, well, that's the short-hand to write out
17:26
the three equations. But it's the picture that I'm looking for today. Okay, so the row picture.
17:32
All right, so I'm in three dimensions, x,
17:38
find out when there isn't a solution. y and z.
17:45
And I want to take those equations one at a time and ask
17:51
-- and make a picture of all the points that satisfy -- let's take equation number two.
17:57
If I make a picture of all the points that satisfy -- all the x, y, z points that solve this equation --
18:05
well, first of all, the origin is not one of them. x, y, z -- it being 0, 0, 0 would not solve that equation.
18:14
So what are some points that do solve the equation? Let's see, maybe if x is one, y and z could be zero.
18:23
That would work, right? So there's one point. I'm looking at this second equation,
18:29
here, just, to start with. Let's see. Also, I guess, if z could be one,
18:36
x and y could be zero, so that would just go straight up that axis.
18:41
And, probably I'd want a third point here. Let me take x to be zero, z to be zero,
18:55
then y would be minus a half, right?
19:00
So there's a third point, somewhere -- oh my -- okay.
19:06
Let's see. I want to put in all the points that satisfy that equation.
19:13
Do you know what that bunch of points will be? It's a plane.
19:19
If we have a linear equation, then, fortunately, the graph of the thing, the plot of all the points that solve it
19:27
are a plane. These three points determine a plane,
19:32
but your lecturer is not Rembrandt
19:37
and the art is going to be the weak point here.
19:43
So I'm just going to draw a plane, right? There's a plane somewhere. That's my plane.
19:50
That plane is all the points that solves this guy. Then, what about this one?
19:59
Two x minus y plus zero z. So z actually can be anything.
20:05
Again, it's going to be another plane. Each row in a three by three problem
20:11
gives us a plane in three dimensions. So this one is going to be some other plane --
20:17
maybe I'll try to draw it like this. And those two planes meet in a line.
20:25
So if I have two equations, just the first two equations in three dimensions, those give me a line.
20:33
The line where those two planes meet. And now, the third guy is a third plane.
20:42
And it goes somewhere.
20:49
Okay, those three things meet in a point. Now I don't know where that point is, frankly.
20:55
But -- linear algebra will find it. The main point is that the three planes, because they're not
21:05
parallel, they're not special. They do meet in one point and that's the solution.
21:11
But, maybe you can see that this row picture is
21:16
getting a little hard to see. The row picture was a cinch when we looked at two lines
21:24
meeting. When we look at three planes meeting, it's not so clear and in four dimensions probably
21:32
a little less clear. So, can I quit on the row picture? Or quit on the row picture before I've successfully
21:41
found the point where the three planes meet? All I really want to see is that the row picture consists
21:51
of three planes and, if everything works right, three planes meet in one point and that's a solution.
21:59
Now, you can tell I prefer the column picture.
22:04
Okay, so let me take the column picture. That's x times --
22:09
so there were two xs in the first equation minus one x is, and no xs in the third.
22:16
It's just the first column of that. And how many ys are there? There's minus one in the first equations, two in the second
22:24
and maybe minus three in the third. Just the second column of my matrix.
22:29
And z times no zs minus one zs and four zs.
22:37
And it's those three columns, right, that I have to combine to produce the right-hand side,
22:46
which is zero minus one four.
22:52
Okay. So what have we got on this left-hand side?
22:57
A linear combination. It's a linear combination now of three vectors, and they happen to be -- each one is a three dimensional
23:05
vector, so we want to know what combination of those three vectors produces that one.
23:12
Shall I try to draw the column picture, then? So, since these vectors have three components --
23:18
so it's some multiple -- let me draw in the first column as before -- x is two and y is minus one.
23:27
Maybe there is the first column.
23:32
y -- the second column has maybe a minus one and a two and the y
23:38
is a minus three, somewhere, there possibly, column two.
23:44
And the third column has -- no zero minus one four, so how shall I draw that?
23:52
So this was the first component. The second component was a minus one.
23:59
Maybe up here. That's column three, that's the column zero minus one and four.
24:08
This guy. So, again, what's my problem?
24:15
What this equation is asking me to do is to combine these three vectors
24:21
with a right combination to produce this one.
24:27
Well, you can see what the right combination is, because
24:33
in this special problem, specially chosen by the lecturer, that right-hand side that I'm trying to get
24:42
is actually one of these columns. So I know how to get that one. So what's the solution?
24:48
What combination will work? I just want one of these and none of these.
24:53
So x should be zero, y should be zero and z should
24:59
be one. That's the combination.
25:04
One of those is obviously the right one. Column three is actually the same
25:09
as b in this particular problem.
25:15
I made it work that way just so we would get an answer, (0,0,1), so somehow that's
25:21
the point where those three planes met and I couldn't see it before.
25:28
Of course, I won't always be able to see it from the column picture, either. It's the next lecture, actually, which is about elimination,
25:39
which is the systematic way that everybody --
25:46
every bit of software, too --
25:51
production, large-scale software would solve the equations. So the lecture that's coming up.
25:59
If I was to add that to the syllabus, will be about how to find x, y, z in all cases.
26:09
Can I just think again, though, about the big picture?
26:15
By the big picture I mean let's keep this same matrix on the left but imagine that we have
26:21
a different right-hand side. Oh, let me take a different right-hand side.
26:27
So I'll change that right-hand side to something that actually is also pretty special.
26:34
Let me change it to -- if I add those first two columns, that would give me a one and a one and a minus three.
26:43
There's a very special right-hand side. I just cooked it up by adding this one to this one.
26:51
Now, what's the solution with this new right-hand side? The solution with this new right-hand side is clear.
26:58
took one of these and none of those.
27:04
So actually, it just changed around to this when I took this new right-hand side.
27:11
Okay. So in the row picture, I have three different planes,
27:19
three new planes meeting now at this point. In the column picture, I have the same three columns,
27:27
but now I'm combining them to produce this guy, and it turned out that column one plus column two which would
27:34
be somewhere -- there is the right column -- one of this and one of this would give me the new b.
27:42
Okay. So we squeezed in an extra example.
27:48
But now think about all bs, all right-hand sides.
27:55
Can I solve these equations for every right-hand side?
28:02
Can I ask that question? So that's the algebra question. Can I solve A x=b for every b?
28:11
Let me write that down. Can I solve A x =b for every right-hand side b?
28:24
I mean, is there a solution? And then, if there is, elimination
28:29
will give me a way to find it. I really wanted to ask, is there a solution for every right-hand side?
28:36
So now, can I put that in different words -- in this linear combination words?
28:43
So in linear combination words, do the linear combinations
28:52
of the columns fill three dimensional space?
29:03
Every b means all the bs in three dimensional space.
29:12
Do you see that I'm just asking the same question in different words?
29:19
Solving A x -- A x -- that's very important.
29:25
A times x -- when I multiply a matrix by a vector,
29:31
I get a combination of the columns. I'll write that down in a moment.
29:38
But in my column picture, that's really what I'm doing. I'm taking linear combinations of these three columns
29:47
and I'm trying to find b. And, actually, the answer for this matrix will be yes.
29:57
For this matrix A -- for these columns, the answer is yes.
30:04
This matrix -- that I chose for an example is a good matrix.
30:19
A non-singular matrix. An invertible matrix. Those will be the matrices that we like best.
30:26
There could be other -- and we will see other matrices where the answer becomes, no --
30:35
oh, actually, you can see when it would become no. What could go wrong? find out -- because if elimination fails,
When could it go wrong
30:43
How could it go wrong that out of these -- out of three columns and all their combinations --
30:51
when would I not be able to produce some b off here?
30:58
When could it go wrong? Do you see that the combinations --
31:04
let me say when it goes wrong. If these three columns all lie in the same plane,
31:12
then their combinations will lie in that same plane.
31:18
So then we're in trouble. If the three columns of my matrix --
31:23
if those three vectors happen to lie in the same plane -- for example, if column three is just
31:31
the sum of column one and column two, I would be in trouble.
31:36
That would be a matrix A where the answer would be no, because the combinations --
31:44
if column three is in the same plane as column one and two, I don't get anything new from that.
31:50
All the combinations are in the plane and only right-hand sides b that I could get would be the ones in that plane.
32:00
So I could solve it for some right-hand sides, when b is in the plane, but most right-hand sides
32:08
would be out of the plane and unreachable. So that would be a singular case.
32:14
The matrix would be not invertible. There would not be a solution for every b.
32:19
The answer would become no for that. Okay.
Nine dimensions
32:25
I don't know -- shall we take just a little shot at thinking about nine dimensions?
32:34
Imagine that we have vectors with nine components.
32:41
Well, it's going to be hard to visualize those. I don't pretend to do it.
32:46
But somehow, pretend you do.
32:51
Pretend we have -- if this was nine equations and nine unknowns, then we would have nine columns,
32:59
and each one would be a vector in nine-dimensional space and we would be looking at their linear combinations.
33:06
So we would be having the linear combinations of nine vectors in nine-dimensional space,
33:12
and we would be trying to find the combination that hit the correct right-hand side b.
33:18
And we might also ask the question can we always do it? Can we get every right-hand side b?
33:25
And certainly it will depend on those nine columns. Sometimes the answer will be yes --
33:32
if I picked a random matrix, it would be yes, actually. If I used MatLab and just used the random command, picked
33:39
out a nine by nine matrix, I guarantee it would be
33:44
good. It would be non-singular, it would be invertible, all beautiful. But if I choose those columns so that they're not independent,
34:00
so that the ninth column is the same as the eighth column,
34:05
then it contributes nothing new and there would be right-hand sides b that I couldn't get.
34:13
Can you sort of think about nine vectors
34:18
in nine-dimensional space an take their combinations? That's really the central thought --
34:26
that you get kind of used to in linear algebra. Even though you can't really visualize it,
34:33
you sort of think you can after a while. Those nine columns and all their combinations
34:40
may very well fill out the whole nine-dimensional space. But if the ninth column happened to be the same as the eighth
34:48
column and gave nothing new, then probably what it would fill out would be --
34:55
I hesitate even to say this -- it would be a sort of a plane
35:03
-- an eight dimensional plane inside nine-dimensional space.
35:10
And it's those eight dimensional planes inside nine-dimensional space that we
35:16
have to work with eventually. For now, let's stay with a nice case where the matrices work,
35:25
we can get every right-hand side b and here we see how to do it with columns.
35:32
Okay. There was one step which I realized I was saying in words that I now want to write in letters.
Matrix form
35:41
Because I'm coming back to the matrix form of the equation, so let me write it here.
35:49
The matrix form of my equation, of my system
35:54
is some matrix A times some vector x equals some right-hand side b.
36:00
Okay. So this is a multiplication. A times x. Matrix times vector, and I just want to say
36:07
how do you multiply a matrix by a vector? Okay, so I'm just going to create a matrix --
36:16
let me take two five one three --
36:21
and let me take a vector x to be, say, 1and 2.
36:28
How do I multiply a matrix by a vector?
36:34
But just think a little bit about matrix notation
36:40
and how to do that in multiplication. So let me say how I multiply a matrix by a vector. Actually, there are two ways to do it.
36:47
Let me tell you my favorite way. It's columns again.
36:52
It's a column at a time. For me, this matrix multiplication
36:57
says I take one of that column and two of that column and add.
37:03
So this is the way I would think of it is one of the first column and two of the second column
37:12
and let's just see what we get. So in the first component I'm getting a two and a ten.
37:21
I'm getting a twelve there. In the second component I'm getting a one and a six, I'm getting a seven.
37:27
So that matrix times that vector is twelve seven.
37:35
Now, you could do that another way. You could do it a row at a time.
37:40
And you would get this twelve -- and actually I pretty much did it here -- this way.
37:45
Two -- I could take that row times my vector. This is the idea of a dot product.
37:53
This vector times this vector, two times one plus five times two is the twelve.
38:00
This vector times this vector -- one times one plus three times two is the seven.
38:06
So I can do it by rows, and in each row times
38:11
my x is what I'll later call a dot product. But I also like to see it by columns.
38:19
I see this as a linear combination of a column. So here's my point. A times x is a combination of the columns of A.
38:36
That's how I hope you will think of A times x when we need
38:43
it. Right now we've got -- with small ones, we can always do it in different ways, but later,
38:51
think of it that way. Okay. So that's the picture for a two by two system.
39:02
And if the right-hand side B happened to be twelve seven, then of course the correct solution would be one two.
39:12
Okay. So let me come back next time to a systematic way,
39:17
using elimination, to find the solution, if there is one,
39:25
to a system of any size and find out--
39:32
because the system-- because if elimination fails-- find out when there isn't a solution.
39:39
Okay. Thanks.
